# Malware-Analysis

During the analysis of the infamous WannaCry ransomware, I conducted a comprehensive examination of the malware's behavior, uncovering crucial insights into its functionality and underlying network connections. By leveraging a variety of specialized tools and techniques, I successfully dissected the malware and generated a proof of concept (POC) that illustrates its operation.

The analysis revealed that WannaCry is a sophisticated ransomware strain that encrypts a victim's files and demands a ransom in exchange for their release. Through reverse engineering and dynamic analysis, I identified the key components of the malware, including its encryption algorithms, propagation mechanisms, and persistence techniques.

To gain a deeper understanding of WannaCry's network behavior, I employed various network monitoring tools, such as Wireshark, to capture and analyze the traffic generated by the malware. This allowed me to map out the communication channels established by WannaCry, including the Command and Control (C2) servers it connects to for command execution and data exfiltration.

Additionally, I utilized sandboxing environments, such as Cuckoo Sandbox, to execute the malware in an isolated and controlled environment. This enabled me to observe its behavior without compromising the security of my own systems. By closely monitoring the system calls, registry modifications, and file system interactions, I gained valuable insights into WannaCry's execution flow and its impact on the infected system.

Through my analysis, I successfully generated a POC that showcases the step-by-step workings of WannaCry, highlighting its infection vectors, payload delivery mechanisms, and the encryption process used to render victims' files inaccessible. The POC serves as a valuable resource for understanding the inner workings of the malware and provides essential information for developing effective mitigation and remediation strategies.

Overall, my analysis of the WannaCry ransomware involved a comprehensive examination of its behavior, utilizing various malware analysis tools and techniques. The generated POC offers a detailed understanding of the malware's operations and network connections, enabling the development of proactive measures to prevent future infections and minimize the impact of similar threats.
